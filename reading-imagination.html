      <p>How Reading Boosts My Understanding and Imagination to Another Level

I thought Ella Lee had just described my own heart after hearing her speech. She expressed a love of reading as well as an intellectual and emotional connection to literature, something I can really identify with. Like her, I've frequently muttered to myself, "Just one more chapter," only to discover that an hour has gone by and I'm still engrossed in the narrative.

For me, reading is a gateway rather than a chore. I felt visible when Ella talked about how books allowed her to experience feelings and viewpoints that were different from her own. After reading, I frequently write in my journal about how characters handle hardships, injustice, terror, or love. These thoughts don't merely remain on paper; they develop into concepts that improve my comprehension of both me and other people. My creativity is fueled by reading, which is what makes it even more special to me. My mind begins creating vivid scenes as soon as I start reading a book. As soon as the characters start speaking in voices I made up, I'm living the story instead of simply reading it. The final page isn't where my imagination ends. It never stops changing the story, blending it with my own, and creating new concepts. I've been able to write in my journal, make up stories, and even think of original answers to problems in my life because to this approach.

I frequently find answers in books, although some individuals look for them online or in chats. A question I've been struggling with for weeks can be answered in a well-written paragraph. The choice made by a fictional character can mirror my own struggles and provide me a fresh perspective. For me, books are like maps and mirrors; they show me who I am and point me in the direction of who I want to be.

If I had to redo Ella's film, I would include the way that writing, particularly journaling, complements reading. I frequently write on my feelings, memories, and new insights after finishing a book. I've improved my emotional development and self-expression because to this habit.

"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his or her point of view," Ella said, quoting Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mockingbird (Lee, 1960). That's what I really think. I've learned to slow down, pay attention, and make an effort to comprehend from books. Every book I read makes me a little smarter, whether it's in a historical context or a fantastical realm.

According to Einstein, "read your children fairy tales if you want them to be more intelligent" (quoted in Elite Educational Institute, n.d.). Every day, with every book I've read and every notebook I've kept, I've lived according to that quote.
